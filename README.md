## Getting Started

The point of the game is to reach the water.
You must escape from the enemies littering the game board.
To move your player, use your arrow keys.

## Instructions
* Move the player using your up, down, left, right arrow keys.
* The enemies will attempt to collide with you, at which point the game resets.
* If you reach the water you win, you have the option to increase difficulty
(you can do so as many times as you like).
